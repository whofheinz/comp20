            <br>My Name: William Hofheinz</br>
            <br>My major: Computer Science</br>
            <br>My IP Address: 2601:184:487f:ad0:2468:72fa:fdc6:d099</br>
            <br>Where I grew up: Winchester, MA</br>
            <br>Something no one would expect about me is that even though my
                last name is German, I am actually 50 percent Italian.</br>
            <br> <img src="tag.jpg" height="300" /> <br>This is a picture of 
            my favorite place in the world, my Nonna's hometown, Tagliacozzo,
            in Italy. </br>
