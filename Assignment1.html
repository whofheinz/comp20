            <br><b>Assignment 1: Get on the Web</b><br/>
            <br><i>My Name</i>: William Hofheinz</br>
            <br><i>My major</i>: Computer Science</br>
            <br><i>IP Address</i>: 2601:184:487f:ad0:2468:72fa:fdc6:d099</br>
            <br><i>Where I grew up</i>: Winchester, MA</br>
            <br>Something no one would expect about me is that even though my
                last name is German, I am actually 50 percent Italian.</br>
            <br> <img src="tag.jpg" height="300" /> <br/>This is a picture of 
            my favorite place in the world, my Nonna's hometown, Tagliacozzo,
            in Italy.
